### End-to-end tests

#### Created tests

 - [Login and created a clarification](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_10-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/clarification/clarification.js#L9)
 - [Login and created an empty clarification](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_10-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/clarification/clarification.js#L16)
 - [Login, check that clarification is unanswered](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_10-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/clarification/clarification.js#L23)
 - [Login, answers a clarification and sees it](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_10-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/clarification/clarification.js#L29)
 - [Login, answers a clarification with empty string and sees error](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_10-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/clarification/clarification.js#L37)
 - [Login, student sees clarification answered](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_10-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/clarification/clarification.js#L44)

#### Rationale
The end-to-end tests test the most common and possible use cases, such as creating a clarification and trying to create an empty one, which should fail, also doing the same thing for creating clarification answers and checking whether or not the clarification status is updated after being answered, and finally verify that the student can see the answer for the submitted clarification.

### End-to-end tests

#### Created tests

 - [Login creates and sees it on open tournaments tab](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_10-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/tournament/tournament.js#L6)
 - [Creates tournament with starting date before the current date](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_10-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/tournament/tournament.js#L59)
 - [Creates tournament with missing title](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_10-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/tournament/tournament.js#L54)
 - [Creates tournament with starting date after conclusion date](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_10-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/tournament/tournament.js#L114)
 - [Login creates tournament and cancels it, checks all tabs](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_10-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/tournament/tournament.js#L20)
 - [Login creates tournament, signs up for it and checks if it is on the signed up tab](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_10-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/tournament/tournament.js#L37)

#### Rationale
The end-to-end tests test for most of the possible use cases. It tests for success, by creating tournaments and seeing whether the tournament shows up on the expected tabs and does the same for signing up aswell as cancelling. Cancelling is being done in pretty much every test to avoid flooding the tournaments tab with tournaments created for the tests, even though that doesn't remove them from the database. Some insuccess cases are also tested like creating tournaments with invalid title and dates.
